<details>
  <summary>How Pub Sub is different from Observer?</summary>
  
  1. Observer
     * Synchronous
     * Tightly coupled - subject knows the observers observing its state
  2. PubSub
     * Asynchronous behaviour
     * Pub and Sub are loosly coupled - they both are not aware about each others existance also
